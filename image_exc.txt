#### Video segmentation - Kate Sorg
# Breaking up the video into individual frames
#
# possible variables needed:
# failedFrames = frames which could not be segmented or otherwise cannot be used
# videoFile = name of video file to be segmented
# something about another video file with the angles of the worm???
#
#
# Workflow of inspiration code:
# 1. test for downsampling
# 2. test for excluding stage movement frames
# 3. open the video and get information
#
# Left to do/areas of possible improvement:
# - testing for downsampling
# - still need to find a way to exclude useless frames (will be done at every stage of processing)
